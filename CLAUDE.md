# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Use `uv run` to execute management commands (Python 3.14, managed via `.python-version`):

```bash
uv run manage.py runserver
uv run manage.py test                          # all tests
uv run manage.py test explorer.my_account      # single app
uv run manage.py migrate
uv run manage.py makemessages -l de -l en      # extract translatable strings (first run)
uv run manage.py makemessages -a               # update existing .po files
uv run manage.py compilemessages               # compile .po → .mo
```

## Architecture

**Project layout:** The Django project package is `explorer/` (contains `settings.py`, `urls.py`). Apps live inside it as sub-packages (e.g. `explorer/my_account/`).

**Custom user model:** `my_account.User` extends `AbstractUser` and is set as `AUTH_USER_MODEL`. All user references must use `get_user_model()` or `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`, not `auth.User` directly.

**i18n:** `LocaleMiddleware` is active. Supported languages are `de` and `en` (default). Translation files live in `locale/` at the project root. Only German needs `.po` entries — English is the source language and has no `.po` file.

**Dependencies** (see `pyproject.toml`): Django 6, `django-allauth` (installed but not yet wired into `INSTALLED_APPS`), `psycopg` (PostgreSQL driver installed but SQLite is used in development).
